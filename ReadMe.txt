Temporary Game Title: Pirate's Bounty

Gameplay Mechanics: 

Map: Map would be influenced by FTL. User would move around strategic map set in the 1700s at the height of Brittish naval power. The story would revolve around smuggling in and out various goods from harbors. Map would be split in "sectors" like in FTL. Each sector having multiple paths to take to rearch the next sector. Each area within a sector would have a random chance to either find a Royal Navy encounter, another pirate encounter, trading vessel, mercenaries, etc for combat encounters. Areas could also contain events where you aid a stranded person, buy wares from merchant vessels, etc.

Differences than FTL: Instead of having the rebels chasing you like in FTL we could have the transported goods have an expiration timer attached to them. Fits in with the whole old timey feel and perishable goods thing. We could still have the Royal Navy chase you if they identify your vessel and then inform the Navy, but it wouldn't be there from the get go.
Another difference could be that unlike FTL you don't have to start over after you deliver your good. You could take on more difficult transportations while upgrade your vessel. However you could still decide on starting a mission from a different perspective like being a pirate and having a fast agile ship, being a merchant and hiring smaller ships to protect you, being a royal navy member and chasing down pirates. Each with their own style of play to keep the game from getting dull.

Encounters: Would be a similar static event similar to FTL. You would have either a top or side view of your vessel and would use your weapons to try to destroy enemy vessels. 
Weapons could include stuff like cannons, throwing anchors, other type of weapnry (probably need to get creative on this). Boarding would remain a big feature with the opportunity to take slaves, have people join your crew, receive bigger rewards since you didn't destroy their ship.

Differences from FTL: I'd like to have boat speed be a factor instead of just pitting both sides against each other like in FTL. Certain weapons would turn on as you get closer to the vessel. Boat agility would help in dodging veseels with a lot of fire power. We could have a little graphic on the top denoting how far away the boat is and show you either gaining on or having been approached by an enemy vessel. Users would have to strategize between getting long range or short range weaponry to carry out their missions. 

Flavorful factors:

Smuggling: Would like to entertain the idea of smaller boats being able to sneak up on larger vessels. Could have a smuggler board the boad and steal some goods. Would require the crew to be on high alert.

Mutiny: Each perspective could have a moral guage that would need to be kept in check or else face a potential mutiny. Would need to worry about who you decide to take in as your crew as they could ignite unrest amongst the other crew members.

More to come

This should give us enough to get started. Feel free to add additional aspects that you think would be cool.
